The automated sepsis screening algorithm replaced the manual sepsis screen 1 year into the study. A positive case was defined as development of severe sepsis or septic shock within 24 hours of disposition from the ED. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and positive and negative likelihood ratios with 95\\% confidence intervals (CIs) for each.There were 122 221 ED encounters during the study period and 273 cases of severe sepsis. During year 1 of the study, the manual screen was performed in 8910 of 61 026 (14.6\\%) encounters, resulting in the following test characteristics: sensitivity of 64.6\\% (95\\% CI 54.2\\%–74.1\\%), specificity of 91.1\\% (95\\% CI 90.5\\%–91.7\\%), PPV of 7.3\\% (95\\% CI 6.3\\%–8.5\\%), and NPV of 99.6\\% (95\\% CI 99.5\\%–99.7\\%). During year 2 of the study, the automated screen was performed in 100\\% of 61 195 encounters, resulting in the following test characteristics: sensitivity of 84.6\\% (95\\% CI 77.4\\%–90.2\\%), specificity of 95.1\\% (95\\% CI 94.9\\%–95.2\\%), PPV of 3.7\\% (95\\% CI 3.4\\%–4\\%), and NPV of 99.9\\% (95\\% CI 99.9\\%–100\\%).An automated sepsis screening algorithm had higher sensitivity and specificity than a widely used manual sepsis screen and was performed on 100\\% of patients in the ED, ensuring continuous sepsis surveillance throughout the ED stay.}",

    abstract = "{In-hospital cardiac arrest is common and associated with a high mortality rate. Despite this, in-hospital cardiac arrest has received little attention compared with other high-risk cardiovascular conditions, such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.In-hospital cardiac arrest occurs in over 290 000 adults each year in the United States. Cohort data from the United States indicate that the mean age of patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest is 66 years, 58\\% are men, and the presenting rhythm is most often (81\\%) nonshockable (ie, asystole or pulseless electrical activity). The cause of the cardiac arrest is most often cardiac (50\\%-60\\%), followed by respiratory insufficiency (15\\%-40\\%). Efforts to prevent in-hospital cardiac arrest require both a system for identifying deteriorating patients and an appropriate interventional response (eg, rapid response teams). The key elements of treatment during cardiac arrest include chest compressions, ventilation, early defibrillation, when applicable, and immediate attention to potentially reversible causes, such as hyperkalemia or hypoxia. There is limited evidence to support more advanced treatments. Post–cardiac arrest care is focused on identification and treatment of the underlying cause, hemodynamic and respiratory support, and potentially employing neuroprotective strategies (eg, targeted temperature management). Although multiple individual factors are associated with outcomes (eg, age, initial rhythm, duration of the cardiac arrest), a multifaceted approach considering both potential for neurological recovery and ongoing multiorgan failure is warranted for prognostication and clinical decision-making in the post–cardiac arrest period. Withdrawal of care in the absence of definite prognostic signs both during and after cardiac arrest should be avoided. Hospitals are encouraged to participate in national quality-improvement initiatives.An estimated 290 000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur each year in the United States. However, there is limited evidence to support clinical decision making. An increased awareness with regard to optimizing clinical care and new research might improve outcomes.}",
